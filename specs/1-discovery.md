# Extracting metadata # {#metadata}

The object of the `tree:view` property is a root node from where all elements in the collection can be reached.

When the current page is an instance of the `tree:Node` class, there MUST be a property linking the current page URL to the URI of the `tree:Collection`. Three properties may be used:
 1. `<collection> tree:view <currentPageUrl> .`<br/>When the entire `tree:Collection` can be reached starting from the current node, i.e. this node is a root node.
 2. `<currentPageUrl> dcterms:isPartOf <collection> .`<br/>When the node is not a root node, but still contains a subset of the collection.

## Multiple Collections ## {#multiple-collections}

The contents of different collections can be disambiguated using the `tree:shape` property, defining to which shape all the collection's members adhere to.
Therefore a data publisher SHOULD annotate a `tree:Collection` instance with a SHACL shape.
The `tree:shape` points to a SHACL description of the shape (`sh:NodeShape`).

Note: the shape can be a blank node, or a named node containing a dereferenceable URL.

## Multiple views ## {#multiple-views}

Multiple views for a single collection MAY be provided, and a TREE client MUST traverse all objects of `tree:view` linked to this particular collection.
Every entity linked from `tree:view` MUST be an root node.

Note: How a client picks the right view is use-case specific. In order to fetch all members, one can be chosen at random. In order to prioritize a specific view, the relations and search forms in the root nodes can be studied for their relation types, path or remaining items.

## Compatibility ## {#compatibility}

### DCAT ### {#dcat}

[[!VOCAB-DCAT-2]] is the standard for Open Data Portals by W3C. In order to find TREE compliant datasets in data portals, there SHOULD be a `dcat:accessURL` from the `dcat:Distribution` to the entrypoint where the `tree:Collection`s are described. Furthermore, there SHOULD be a `dct:conformsTo` containing this URI: `https://w3id.org/tree`.

### Hydra ### {#hydra}

A `tree:Collection` is compatible with the [Hydra Collections specification](https://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/#collections). However, instead of `hydra:view`, we use `tree:view` and do not link to a `hydra:PartialCollectionView` but to a `tree:Node`.
A `hydra:Collection` can thus also be extended with a `tree:shape` and `tree:view`.
When this is done, also `hydra:member` can be used instead of `tree:member`.

`hydra:totalItems` can be used to indicate the total amount of elements in the collection.

Hydra paging controls such as first, last, next and previous MUST be ignored.

### Activity Streams 2.0 ### {#activitystreams}

A `tree:Collection` is also compatible with [[!activitystreams-core]]â€™s specification of [paged collections](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#collections).
Instead of `dcterms:isPartOf`, also `as:partOf` can be used to indicate that the current page is part of the full collection.
While Hydra and TREE link to the members of the collection by using the specific collection as a subject, Activity Streams 2.0 (AS) indicates a member starting from the page URL.
Therefore, when using AS collections, a client implementation should gather the members from the `tree:Node` or `as:CollectionPage` instead.

`as:totalItems` can be used to indicate the total amount of members in the collection.

AS paging controls such as first, last, next and previous MUST be ignored.

### LDP Containers ### {#ldp}

Another relevant spec is [[!LDP]].
There, the `tree:view` can be applied on top of the `ldp:Container` instance.
Members can be found through `ldp:contains`, and/or through the indirect `ldp:membershipResource` and `ldp:hasMemberRelation` or `ldp:isMemberOfRelation` construct.

If this container is paged by the [[!ldp-paging]] (chapter 7) spec, then this MUST be ignored.

If there is an ordering, this MUST be ignored by TREE clients.

### Shape trees ### {#shapetrees}

[The Shape Trees specification](https://shapetrees.github.io/specification/spec) is specifically built to work within existing ecosystems.
As it was conceived to interoperate with LDP, the term Container in the Shape Trees spec can also be interpreted as a `tree:Collection`.
Shape Trees can help in the source selection of what specific `tree:Collection` to pick for your goal, and may add hiearchies to a set of `tree:Collection`s.
A client MAY infer a `tree:shape` of the collection through the `st:validatedBy` property of the Shapes Tree.
